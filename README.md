# Election_Analysis


The purpose of the election audit analysis is to determine the voter turnout of each country, find the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and to determine the county with the highest turnout. 
After performing my analysis, I was able to determine the following:
-	There was a total of 3069,711 total congressional votes.
-	The number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct. County Votes: Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855) Denver: 82.8% (306,055) Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
-	The county that had the highest number of votes is Dever
-	The number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received. Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213) Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892) Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-	The candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes. (Winner: Diana DeGette. Winning Vote Count: 272,892. Winning Percentage: 73.8%)

In summary this information can be used to target which counties have the highest turnouts and can be used by candidates to focus on specific counties as well as determine which county can use more campaigning to bring out more votes. For example, 82.8 % of the votes come from Denver that information could be vital for campaigning. Denver should be a focal appointment for any candidate. This analysis can be applied to other states and counties if the data is made available. You can also run this same analysis from previous years to understand the voting trends as well.
